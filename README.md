# 🚀 Underwater Pipe Leakage and Crack Detection Robot
### 🎯 Project Objective
To design and build a cost-effective underwater pipe inspection robot capable of:

- Detecting leakages using sound frequency (acoustic AI)

- Detecting cracks using a camera and computer vision

- Performing edge computation and real-time analysis using Raspberry Pi

- Saving only crucial video clips (10s before & after detection)

- Marking defect locations with distance using a rotary encoder

### 🧠 Inspiration
- Leak Detection Robot – Acoustic leak detection, autonomous pipe navigation.

- Instructables Pipe Inspection Robot – Triangular 3-wheel configuration with chassis design for pipe environments.

- We’re taking the core idea and enhancing it with:

- Edge AI for crack detection

- Acoustic AI for leak detection

- SD card logging

- Distance tracking & image marking
